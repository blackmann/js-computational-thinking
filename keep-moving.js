 * boosters enabled - allowing it to break through the wall and keep going.
 *
 * The program below is supposed to help the ATV determine if should keep
 * going or come at a halt.
 *
 * Return `true` if it should keep going. Return `false` otherwise
 *
 * NB: For this example, the ATV can only be blocked by walls
